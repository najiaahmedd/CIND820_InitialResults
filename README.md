# CIND820_InitialResults

This repository contains the following technical documents:

1. Imputation results using MICE
2. Data cleaning and data clustering
4. Decision Tree
5. Multiple regression analysis 

These technical documents will provide a first look into how the data is peforming and if there are any issues requiring any other further steps as we move forward through the research project. 

At this point it was decided that the dataset to be used for the project is below:

https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/all-natural-disasters-19002021-eosdis

We will be utilizing the second .csv file that has data on natural disasters that have occurred between 1970 and 2021. 

The tentative stages of this project is to retrieve initial results to answer the following research questions with the respective technique that will be used listed underneath:

(a) How have different natural disasters (types) been trending over the years? 
  - Data clustering 


(b) Which countries are experiencing the most natural disasters and which type?
  - Data clustering 


(c) Can we predict which natural disaster will become more common or likely to occur? 
  - Decision tree, multiple regression analysis
